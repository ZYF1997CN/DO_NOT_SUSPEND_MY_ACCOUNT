# Github suspended my account and still has not given me back.
# The reason is funny:
>Hello @YuanfengZhang,
We recently noticed that your GitHub account had a suspicious login. Out of an abundance of caution, we made the decision to force a password reset for the account associated with this email address.
We have no reason to believe that this was the result of a GitHub vulnerability. While we canâ€™t speak to your particular case, in other similar account takeovers our users have told us that infostealer malware was discovered on their system.
Follow the link below to request a password reset token.

To protect your account from unauthorized access, please choose a strong and unique password for your account. We have a help article with some recommendations here:
https://docs.github.com/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-strong-password
If you have not already done so, we strongly recommend taking the additional step to secure your account with two-factor authentication. The following guide provides step-by-step instructions:
https://docs.github.com/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication
After you sign in, please review your security history for suspicious or malicious activity.
https://github.com/settings/security
Please also check for any suspicious starring activity and any malicious activity on repositories you own or have access to, paying particular attention to repositories with names you do not recognize and any repositories that have recently been created. For more information, read Deleting a repository in the GitHub Docs;
https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/deleting-a-repository
If you have specific concerns you may contact our support team by submitting a message through our contact form.

This was sent from Github at 7:39 PM, 15/04/2024. Once I saw this email on the next morning, I clicked the link but the webpage told me it was expired.
# And since then the login page showed me that my account had been suspended. And I quote:
>Access to your account has been suspended due to a violation of our Terms of Service. Please contact support for more information.

It's illegial for Github users to sleep or what?

# If the warning is true, why did not Github ask us for 2FA? Why did Github suspend my account and give no reply since then instead of letting me try my 2FA?
# If 2FA is nothing to Github, why does Github recommend users to apply it?
# STOP SUSPEND MY ACCOUNT!!!
